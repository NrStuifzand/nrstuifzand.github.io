<p>If you have decided to invite a furry friend into your life,  congratulations! If you are thinking about rescuing a dog instead of buying  one, you should! There are many benefits when adopting or rescuing a dog  instead of buying one; this doesn&rsquo;t mean that buying one is bad mind you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There a ton of dogs in shelters looking for homes</h2>
  <p>An estimated of 26 dogs are in each shelter waiting for a  forever home to go to. Shelters also have varying types, ages, and sizes of  dogs, so with time, you can find the dog that is perfect for you. Plus, you  then know exactly what kind of dog they are and how big they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You will feel like a better person</h2>
<p>You will feel like a better person because your canine  friend will always be there for you and give you unconditional love no matter what.  You'll also feel better because you rescued them from a shelter and gave them a  safe and loving home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You will be providing them with a home</h2>
<p>By adopting or rescuing a dog, you are providing them with a  safe home where they are comfortable and happy. </p>
